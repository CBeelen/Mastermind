# Mastermind
A little side project to practice Python.

Simulates the board game master mind, in which one player must guess the color combination of another player with the help of feedback for each guess.

There are two modes: one in which the user must guess the computer's combination, and one in which the computer attempts to guess the user's combination (very badly so far).
